import SwiftUI

/// A property wrapper that can playback audio.
///
/// > Important:
/// The underlying player is managed as a `@State` property wrapper.
/// As a result, rapid or successive calls to the `OdioPlayer` instance may not play audio if a previous playback is still active.
/// This is particularly noticeable with lengthy audio files or quick successive calls.
/// If this becomes a concern, call the `end()` method before initiating a new playback.
///
/// Use the `FileKey` overload initializer to quickly and safely initialize a new `@AudioPlayer`.
/// ```swift
/// extension FileKey {
///   static let tap = FileKey(value: "TapSound.mp3")
/// }
///
/// @AudioPlayer(.tap) private var audioPlayer
/// ```
///
/// You can also initialize an empty `@AudioPlayer`, useful when the audio file to use is not known initially.
/// ```swift
/// struct SoundOnTap: ViewModifier {
///   @AudioPlayer private var audioPlayer
///
///   let name: String
///
///   func body(content: Content) -> some View {
///     content
///       .simultaneousGesture(
///         TapGesture()
///           .onEnded { audioPlayer() })
///       .onAppear { audioPlayer = OdioPlayer(name) }
///       .onDisappear { audioPlayer.stop() }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Initialize an instance of `@AudioPlayer`with playback delay.
/// Here, playback will occur after a delay of one second.
/// ```swift
/// struct DelayView: View {
///   @AudioPlayer(.tap, after: 1.0) private var audioPlayer
///
///   var body: some View {
///     Button("Tap Me") { audioPlayer() }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Refer directly to an instance of `@AudioPlayer` to implicitly access its wrapped value.
/// ```swift
/// struct SoundView: View {
///   @AudioPlayer("TapSound.mp3") private var audioPlayer
///
///   var body: some View {
///       Button("Play Sound") { audioPlayer() }
///
///       Button("New Sound") { audioPlayer = .init("ThunderSound.mp3") }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
